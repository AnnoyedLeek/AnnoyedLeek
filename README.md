 👋 Howdy, I'm Tehya.
 -  Professionally, I’m interested in Windows and Linux-based systems administration, automation, virtualization, containerization, and any other buzzwords found on your favorite flavor of tech blog.
 -  Personally, I'm into ADHD-fueled bi-monthly weekend benders of early '00s management games, hanging out with my three incredibly annoying cats, automating my life through open-source IOT, and synthesizing homegrown solutions to address mundane problems.
 
 -  🌱 I’m currently learning enterprise-level automation via PowerShell and Ansible.
 -  💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exchanging megalists of time-wasting, niche open-source software.
