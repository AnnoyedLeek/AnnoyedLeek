- 👋 Hi, I’m @AnnoyedLeek.
- 👀 Professionally, I’m interested in systems administration, automation, virtualization, containerization, and any other buzzwords found on your favorite tech blog.
- 👀 Personally, I'm into breaking test domains, automating my life through open-source IOT, and synthesizing homegrown solutions to address mundane problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning enterprise-level automation via PowerShell and Ansible...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exchanging oddball open-source software...
- 📫 Reach me anywhere my handle can be found!
